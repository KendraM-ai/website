# Ms. M's Classroom Website !4

**Live site:** https://kendram-ai.github.io/website/

A static, purple-themed classroom site hosted on **GitHub Pages** — GitHub's free static site hosting service. When you push a change to the `main` branch, the included GitHub Actions workflow automatically packages the files and publishes them to that URL within about a minute. There is no server to manage, no hosting bill, and no deployments to trigger manually — a commit is all it takes.

## Updating Class Content (No Coding Required!)

All class content lives in the **`content/`** folder as plain Markdown (`.md`) files. You can edit them directly on GitHub without installing anything.

| File | Section |
|------|---------|
| `content/english3.md` | English 3 |
| `content/english3-honors.md` | English 3 Honors |
| `content/ap-lang.md` | AP Language & Composition |
| `content/yearbook.md` | Yearbook |

### How to edit a file on GitHub

1. Open the file on GitHub (e.g., `content/english3.md`)
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top-right corner
3. Make your changes using the simple Markdown format shown below
4. Click **"Commit changes"** at the bottom — the site will update in about a minute!

## Customizing the Site

- **Current school name** — `Bishop McLaughlin Catholic High School` appears in the header tagline and footer in `index.html`
- **Change the color scheme** — edit the CSS variables at the top of `css/styles.css`
- **Add a new section** — duplicate one of the `<section class="class-section">` blocks in `index.html` and create a matching `.md` file in `content/`
